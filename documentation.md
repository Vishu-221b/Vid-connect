# Introduction to Files Created Using React Vite

1. **Package.json**: This file is a crucial configuration file used to manage project dependencies, scripts, and other metadata about the project.

2. **Package-lock.json**: The primary purpose of `package-lock.json` is to provide dependency version information for your project, ensuring that the exact same versions of dependencies are consistently installed in different environments.

3. **.gitignore**: A `.gitignore` file is a configuration file used in Git to specify which files and directories should be ignored by the version control system.

4. **Readme.md, Documentation.md**: These files contain basic and detailed documentation of the project.

5. **.env/.env.example**: The `.env` file, often referred to as an environment variable file, is a configuration file used to store environment-specific settings and configuration values for software applications. It's a plain text file typically named `.env` (short for "environment") and is used to define key-value pairs of variables that your application can access.

6. **Public Directory**: In React, the `public` directory is a special directory used for serving static assets and files that don't need to go through the build process. It's often used to store files like images, fonts, and HTML files that should be included in the final build of your React application as-is, without being transformed or bundled by tools like Webpack or Babel.

7. **src Directory**: This directory is where you typically place your source code and React components. Vite is a build tool that's designed to be fast and efficient, and it uses the `src` directory as the entry point for your project.
